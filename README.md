# Cybersecurity Bootcamp Capstone Project  |  HackTheBox Challenge Walkthrough 

## Objective

Our group project focused on developing a comprehensive walkthrough for the Photon Lockdown challenge on Hack The Box (HTB). This challenge required us to crack a code and locate the hidden flag. Through collaborative efforts, we documented our approach and solutions, providing detailed insights and step-by-steo instruction to help others solve the challenge. 


### Skills Learned

#### Penetration Testing
- Gaining practical expereince in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- Learning techniques for cracking codes and uncovering hidden flags.

#### Collaboration and Teamwork
- Working effectively with team members to solve complex problems.
- Sharing knowledge and coordinating efforts to achieve a common goal.

#### Technical Writing
- Documenting the problem-solving process clearly and comprehensively.
- Creating detailed walkthroughs that can be understood and followed by others.

#### Problem-Solving
- Applying critical thinking and analytical skills to overcome challenges.
- Developing systematic approaches to troubleshooting and resolving issues.

#### Research and Analysis
-  Conducting thorough research to understand the challenge requirements.
-  Analyzing different methos and techniques to find the most effective solution.

#### Persistence and Patience
- Demonstrating determination in solving complex challenges.
- Learning to be patient and methodical in the face of difficult tasks.

#### Communication Skills
- Effectively communicating technical details and findings to team members.
- Presenting the final walkthrough in a clear and organized manner.


### Tools Used

#### Virtual Machines
- Kali Linux virtual machine used for the project.

#### Linux Command Line Tools
- Basic command line tools like "grep", "find", "unzip", "cat", "file", "ls-la", "sudo unsquashfs" and others to solve the task.

#### Hack The Box Site
- We accessed the Hack The Box site for the challenge information and the file.
- Hack The Box (HTB) is an open source cybersecurity training platform that provides a variety of hacking experiences, from labs and challenges to capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions and educational content. The challenged solved was the "Photon Lockdown" challenge. The Photon Lockdown is a challenge that requires users to crack a code by finding a flag.
